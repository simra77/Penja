n the ancient land of Sangoku, where emerald green mountains kissed the heavens and tranquil rivers flowed with wisdom, there lived a humble farmer named Hiroshi. He toiled under the golden sun, tending to his rice fields with unwavering dedication.

One fateful day, as Hiroshi toiled in the fields, he discovered a small, intricately carved stone statue hidden amidst the tall grass. The statue depicted a mythical creature, half-dragon and half-lion, known as a "sangoku." Legend had it that the sangoku possessed extraordinary powers and could bring fortune to those who revered it.

Intrigued by the legend, Hiroshi decided to bring the sangoku statue home and placed it in a small shrine within his humble abode. Little did he know that his simple act would set off a chain of events that would forever change his life.
